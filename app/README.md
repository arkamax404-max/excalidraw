# Application (frontend and server)

The React frontend and the Express server of this self-hosted Excalidraw fork. See
the repository root `README.md` for the deployment overview, the Compose workflow and
the full environment-variable table.

- `src/`: React frontend (Excalidraw embedded through `@excalidraw/excalidraw`), the
  AI prompt dialog, and the Mermaid conversion and export helpers.
- `server.mjs`: Express server: session login, per-user diagram storage, JSON backups
  and the AI generation endpoint.
- `openrouter.mjs`: OpenRouter request with the validated Groq fallback chain.
- `dist/`: built frontend, served by the Express server.
- `scripts/hash-password.mjs`: bcrypt hash generator for provisioning users.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm ci` | Install dependencies exactly as locked |
| `npm run dev` | Vite development server for the frontend |
| `npm run build` | Build the frontend into `dist/` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the project |
| `npm test` | `node --test` over the server and helper tests |
| `npm start` | Run `server.mjs` (expects a reachable PostgreSQL instance) |
| `npm run hash-password -- <password>` | Print a bcrypt hash for `db/create-user.example.sql` |

The Vite development server defines no proxy for the backend API, so authenticated
operation requires either routing `/api` to the Express server or the build-and-start
workflow:

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## HTTP API

The server exposes the session cookie `excalidraw.sid`; every route below except the
authentication routes requires an authenticated session.

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/session` | Session lifecycle |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/users` | User management; requires the account named exactly `admin` |
| `GET /api/files`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/files/:name` | Per-user diagram storage; `PUT` takes the raw scene object |
| `POST /api/ai/diagram` | Prompt to Mermaid through OpenRouter with the Groq fallback chain |

Diagram names are normalized server-side: NFKC, runs of characters outside
`[\w\- ]` and whitespace runs become `-`, leading and trailing `[-_. ]` are stripped,
the result is lowercased, truncated to 80 characters, and an empty result becomes
`diagrama-1`.
